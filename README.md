# node-seed-project

Seed project and other code samples useful for starting new projects

Currently only contains a backend seed under `/server`. See README in `server` for more info.
Currently comprised of a mixed JS/TS codebase due to incrementally switching over to Typescript

Will be a continual work in progress
